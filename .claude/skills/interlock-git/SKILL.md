# Git operations in Interlock

Interlock reads repositories people are actively working in. A write to a user's
index destroys uncommitted work that was never recoverable in the first place.
Everything here exists to make that impossible rather than unlikely.

## The two handle types

`packages/core/src/git/repo-handle.ts` defines `UserRepo` and `ShadowRepo`.
Mutating functions take a `ShadowRepo`, and `ensureShadow` is the only function
that produces one, so a write against a user path is a compile error rather than
something review has to catch.

Never widen a signature to `AnyRepo` to make something typecheck. If a function
needs to write, it needs a `ShadowRepo`; if it cannot get one, the call site is
wrong.

The type split is the design, not a convention. `isMutatingCommand` enforces the
same rule at run time because types do not survive a `JSON.parse` from the API
layer.

## Invoking git

Always `execFile` with an argument array. Never a shell, never a template
string:

```ts
// wrong — a branch named `--upload-pack=…` or `; rm -rf ~` executes
exec(`git -C ${repo.rootPath} log ${branch}`);

// right
runner.run(repo, ['log', '--format=%H', branch]);
```

Branch names, paths and refs are attacker-controlled in this product: they come
from repositories written by AI agents. Treat every one as hostile input.

Set on every invocation:

- `-C <path>` rather than `process.chdir` — the daemon watches several repos
  concurrently and `chdir` is process-global.
- `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` so a credential prompt fails instead of hanging.
- `GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0` so read commands never take `index.lock`. Without this
  a plain `git status` can block the user's own git.
- `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null` and `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM=/dev/null` so a user's
  aliases, hooks or `merge.tool` cannot change behaviour or execute code.
- A timeout and `maxBuffer`. A hung git must not wedge the daemon.

Close the child's stdin. Nothing here writes to git, and a command that reads it
— `hash-object --stdin`, `update-index --stdin` — otherwise blocks on an open
pipe until the timeout kills it: 30 s instead of 8 ms.

A repository's `.interlock.json` is attacker-controlled the same way its branch
names are. Never build a regex from anything in it: a glob alternating wildcards
with literals takes 20 seconds at 33 characters once translated, on the event
loop, for every branch it is tried against. Scan instead.

Use `-z` and NUL-separated parsing for anything listing paths. Git paths may
contain spaces, quotes and newlines, and newline-splitting `git diff --name-only`
is the classic way to corrupt a file list.

## Never touching the user's index

To snapshot uncommitted work, point git at a different index:

```ts
// An index outside the repo; objects are additive and safe, the index is not
const tmpIndex = join(mkdtempSync(join(tmpdir(), 'interlock-')), 'index');
await runner.run(repo, ['add', '-A'], { indexFile: tmpIndex });
const tree = await runner.run(repo, ['write-tree'], { indexFile: tmpIndex });
```

Writing objects into the user's object database is fine — it is append-only and
`git gc` reclaims anything unreferenced. Writing `.git/index`, moving refs,
stashing or changing config is not, ever.

Always remove the temp index on the error path too. Prefer `try/finally` over
cleanup at the end of the happy path.

`indexFile` is the runner's only environment capability, deliberately. The
runner strips inherited `GIT_*` variables so a user's shell cannot redirect a
command, and an open environment map would hand that redirection straight back
to any caller.

Redirecting the index protects the index and nothing else. Three flags walk
straight past it:

- `read-tree -u` updates the **working tree** to match the index it built, so a
  redirected index only means it overwrites uncommitted edits from a different
  tree.
- `read-tree --index-output=<path>` overrides `GIT_INDEX_FILE`, so the path that
  was validated is not the path git writes.
- `update-index --split-index` leaves a `sharedindex.*` file in `$GIT_DIR`
  whatever `GIT_INDEX_FILE` says.

So classify flags with an **allowlist per verb**, never a list of dangerous ones.
A denylist of flags fails open exactly as a denylist of verbs does, and none of
these three reads like a write. Two properties of git's parser decide how to
match:

- **Any unambiguous prefix resolves.** `--index-out=`, `--index=` and `--i=` are
  all `--index-output=`; `--d` is `--delete`. Match long flags by prefix, and
  only against names git really has — an invented one licenses abbreviations
  that resolve somewhere else.
- **Short flags bundle.** `-um` enables `-u`, so match per character.

The same letter means different things to different verbs — `-u` on `add` is
`--update` and harmless, `-u` on `read-tree` writes the worktree — so the
allowlist is keyed by verb, never global. Stop scanning at `--`: a file named
`-u` is a path.

Validate a redirection with `realpath`, never `resolve`. `resolve` normalises a
path; it does not follow a symlink, and on macOS `tmpdir()` returns
`/var/folders/...` for a directory whose real path is `/private/var/folders/...`,
so two names for the same file compare as different. The index file does not
exist yet, so resolve its parent directory and rejoin the basename.

Test containment on whole path segments. `relative('/repo', '/repo/..bak')`
returns `'..bak'`, so a `..` prefix test calls a path inside the repository
outside it — compare against `'..'` and `'..' + sep`.

Check the redirection against the **shared** git directory too. A linked
worktree's git dir is `<main>/.git/worktrees/<name>`, so its handle names neither
the main checkout nor `<main>/.git` — and the index a redirection must miss lives
in both.

## Merging without a worktree

Prefer `git merge-tree --write-tree` (git 2.38+) over checking out a worktree
and running `git merge`. It performs a real `ort` merge entirely in the object
database, returns the resulting tree, and reports conflicts — with no checkout,
no working directory and no lock.

This matters more than it looks. Interlock analyses N(N-1)/2 pairs continuously,
and a worktree checkout per pair is the difference between fitting a laptop CPU
budget and not.

**`merge-tree` is not a semantic filter.** It answers "do these two conflict
textually", and a semantic conflict is by definition a merge that came out
clean — so it walks straight through. Every clean merge is still a typecheck
candidate. What decides the real cost is the scheduler's overlap test, not the
merge.

When an analyzer must execute the merged code, use the **per-pair worktree pool**
(ADR-0005) — a small LRU set of persistent worktrees, one per hot pair. Update a
slot by delta, never by rebuilding it:

```
tree=$(git merge-tree --write-tree "$a" "$b")   # 12.8 ms on a 794k-line repo
commit=$(git commit-tree "$tree" -m speculative)
git -C "$slot" reset --hard "$commit"           # rewrites only what differs
```

Extracting the whole tree instead costs 1.62 s on that repo — two orders of
magnitude more than the merge, and unaffordable per check.

- Pool worktrees keep a **detached HEAD**, so no branch ref moves and the
  throwaway commits stay unreferenced for `gc`.
- `reset --hard` is a mutating command, allowed here only because pool
  worktrees belong to the shadow clone. The runtime check still applies.
- Symlink `node_modules` from the user's checkout instead of installing.
- `.tsbuildinfo` stays in the slot between checks. That persistence is the
  entire reason continuous checking is affordable, so never clear a slot as a
  "cleanup" step.

The symlink is only valid while dependencies match. If either branch changed
`package.json` or the lockfile, that pair needs a slower path with a real
install — or it skips the semantic check and says why. Silently typechecking
against the wrong dependency tree produces confident nonsense.

## Conflicts are results, not errors

A conflicted merge is a successful analysis with a finding. Throw only when the
merge could not be attempted at all: missing object, no merge-base, git absent.
Returning an empty result for a failed run would let a broken analyzer look like
"no conflicts found", which is the worst possible failure mode for this product.

Environmental failures are `infra-failure`, never a `Finding`.

## Testing git code

Integration tests over unit tests. A unit test with a mocked `GitRunner` proves
the mock works. Build a real repository in a temp directory:

- Create it with `git init`, commit through the runner, and tear the directory
  down in `afterEach` even when the test failed.
- Set `user.name` and `user.email` locally in the fixture; CI has no global git
  identity and `git commit` will fail without them.
- Set `-c init.defaultBranch=main` explicitly rather than depending on the
  runner's git version.
- Never depend on the ambient repository. A test that runs `git` in the
  Interlock checkout will pass locally and behave unpredictably in CI.

Cover these cases whenever you touch discovery, snapshots or merges — each has
broken a real tool: a repository with no commits; a detached HEAD; a branch
checked out in a linked worktree; a worktree directory deleted while its
administrative file remains; two branches with no common ancestor; a path
containing a space and a path containing a newline; a file that is binary; a
rename plus an edit on the same path.

Fixtures may assume POSIX. Tests shell out to `#!/bin/sh` spy scripts, set modes
with `chmod`, and stub `HOME`; CI runs ubuntu and macOS only. Write the clearest
POSIX fixture rather than a portable one, and if Windows is ever supported this
is the decision to revisit — in one place, not per test.

Git's help output is not a stable format. 2.39 prints `-n, --dry-run` where 2.55
prints `-n, --[no-]dry-run`, so a test reading `git <verb> -h` must parse flag
names out and treat `--[no-]x` as both `--x` and `--no-x`. Matching the
surrounding prose passes on the local git and fails on whatever CI has.

The suite in `packages/core/test/user-repo-untouched.test.ts` hashes worktree,
index, refs, stash and config before and after a run. Any new git code path gets
exercised by it. It is never skipped and never weakened — a failure there means
Interlock corrupted someone's work.
