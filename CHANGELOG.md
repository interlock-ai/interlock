The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). User-visible changes get an entry in the same PR that makes them.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- A data directory inside a watched repository is refused. The daemon refuses to start with one, before it writes its lock, database or token, and names the repository and `INTERLOCK_DATA_DIR` in the error. Every watched repository counts, along with each of its worktrees, its git directory, and any of them reached through a symlink; a watched path that is not a repository yet is protected as itself.
- git 2.41 or later is required. Speculative merges run `git merge-tree` against a supplied merge base, reading the repository's attributes from a commit, which older git cannot do; with an older one the daemon reports the toolchain as unsupported rather than a failed merge. macOS's bundled git is 2.39.

### Added

- One daemon per data directory. A second daemon started against a directory another is already using refuses to start and says so, whatever port it was given; the first keeps running. The claim is released when the daemon exits, including when it is killed outright, so a crash never leaves the directory unusable.
- Agent session hooks. `interlock hook <start|activity|end> --kind <agent>` reports an agent session to the daemon from the agent's own hook, reading the hook payload from stdin and finding the daemon the way `status` does — so no token or port ever lands in a hook file inside a repository. The daemon maps the session to the worktree it ran in, marks the branch `inferred` unless the hook named it, and reaps sessions whose process is gone or whose heartbeat is older than `sessions.staleAfterMs`. `interlock status` shows which agent is driving each branch. `POST /api/sessions` is the API's first and only write, behind the same token as everything else, with the body capped and every field checked.
- The daemon reads `config.json` from its data dir, so `repos` can be set without editing source. The data dir comes from `INTERLOCK_DATA_DIR` — the same variable `interlock status` reads — and a `dataDir` key inside the file is refused. An unknown key at any level, a section that is not an object, and a malformed file each refuse to load and name what is wrong; a missing file means the defaults, a file that exists but cannot be read does not. `~/` is expanded in repository paths; any other relative path is refused.
- `interlock status` — in-flight branches, their dirty state and the files they touched, read from the daemon over the localhost API. A worktree that could not be read shows as `unknown` rather than clean. `--json` emits the same facts for scripts, `--data-dir` and `INTERLOCK_DATA_DIR` say which daemon to ask, and the exit codes are `0` when it could report, `64` for bad arguments, `69` when no daemon is reachable and `70` otherwise. Open findings do not change the exit code.
- The daemon runs: watcher, event bus and SQLite store wired together behind a loopback HTTP API. It binds `127.0.0.1` only and authenticates every request — including ones for paths that do not exist — with a bearer token generated at first start and stored 0600. The port it bound is published to `daemon.json` in the data dir so the CLI can find it, and removed on a clean stop. Serves `/api/health`, `/api/repos` and `/api/repos/:id/branches`.
- Per-repository configuration: `.interlock.json` in a repository root overrides `ignore`, `ignoreBranches` and `toolchain` commands. Validated against the schema, with unknown keys and malformed files refused rather than ignored.
- Monorepo scaffold: pnpm workspaces, strict TypeScript with project references, ESLint (flat config, type-aware, with layering rules), Prettier, Vitest, GitHub Actions CI.
- `@interlock/shared`: data models (Repo, BranchRef, AgentSession, ChangeSet, MergePair, SpeculativeRun, Finding, Advice, EventRecord), event vocabulary, config schema with validation, typed errors, structured logging with secret redaction, ULID generation.
- `@interlock/core`: `UserRepo`/`ShadowRepo` handles, the git runner enforcing them, the `Analyzer` contract, finding ranking; contracts for git discovery, dirty-state capture and speculative merge.
- `@interlock/daemon`: event bus with causality tracking; contracts for watcher, scheduler, SQLite store, session hooks and the localhost API.
- `@interlock/mcp-server`: agent tool schemas and `wrapUntrusted()` prompt-injection containment.
- `@interlock/cli`: command surface.
- Documentation: architecture, evaluation protocols, threat model, ADR-0001…0004, scheduler algorithm notes.
- Evaluation harness entry point outside the workspace.
- Licensing: AGPL-3.0-only with a commercial exception (ADR-0002).
