/**
 * The analyzer contract.
 *
 * Analyzers form a pipeline ordered cheapest first: textual → ast-semantic →
 * typecheck → build → test. Each sees the merged shadow tree plus both sides'
 * ChangeSets and returns Findings with evidence, or a non-verdict.
 *
 * Two rules every implementation must respect:
 *  1. An analyzer that cannot run returns `infra-failure`; it never invents a
 *     Finding, and an infra failure is never shown to the user as a conflict.
 *  2. Anything executing repository code goes through the sandbox.
