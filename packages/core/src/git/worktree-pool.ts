/**
 * The per-pair worktree pool: a few persistent checkouts cut from the shadow,
 * each holding one clean pair's merged tree on disk for a semantic check to
 * read.
 *
 * A slot outlives any single check because what accumulates inside it —
 * `.tsbuildinfo`, a build orchestrator's cache — is what makes the next check
 * of that pair cost the change rather than the repository. So a slot is
 * updated by delta, never rebuilt: the merged tree is wrapped in a throwaway
 * commit and the slot is `reset --hard` to it, which rewrites the files that
 * differ and leaves untracked and ignored files where they are.
 *
 * Slots keep a detached `HEAD`, so no ref moves; the commit a slot holds is a
 * root for git's own `prune` for as long as the slot exists, and the one before
 * it is not.
 *
 * This module sits beside `ensureShadow` because it mints `ShadowRepo` handles
 * of its own — one per slot, rooted at the slot and naming the shadow's
 * `worktrees/<name>` as its git directory — and a writable handle may only be
 * derived from one `ensureShadow` returned. Every slot handle is built here
 * from the pool's shadow, and nothing else in the codebase builds one.
