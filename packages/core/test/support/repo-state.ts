/**
 * A byte-for-byte account of a repository, so a run can be proven to have left
 * it alone.
 *
 * A list of files git might write is a guess at what nobody thought of, and the
 * point is to catch what nobody thought of. So this walks everything: the
 * worktree, and everything under the git directory — the index, every ref
 * loose or packed, every reflog, `ORIG_HEAD` and `MERGE_HEAD` and `FETCH_HEAD`,
 * the config, the stash, a rebase in progress, submodule git dirs — and records
 * content, mode and mtime for each.
 *
 * One directory is allowed to grow. A snapshot writes a tree into `objects/`,
 * and the object store is append-only: `gc` reclaims what nothing references,
 * and a new object changes no existing byte. An object that changed or vanished
 * is still a write.
 *
 * One more thing is allowed there, and it was found by this suite rather than
 * anticipated: writing an object that already exists makes git `utime` the
 * existing file — `freshen_loose_object`, so that `gc --prune=<time>` does not
 * reap an object something just referenced again. Content, mode and size of an
 * object are still held to the byte; its mtime is git's to move.
