/**
 * SQLite persistence.
 *
 * Migrations exist from the first schema onward: the store outlives every
 * refactor, and a corrupt local database costs an afternoon.
 *
 * Built on `node:sqlite`, which ships with Node and keeps the daemon free of a
 * native dependency. Its API is synchronous while this interface is not, so a
 * later move to a driver that does real I/O off-thread does not become a change
 * to every caller.
 *
 * The database lives under the Interlock data dir with owner-only permissions.
 * It holds no secrets and no full file contents — evidence stores spans and
 * truncated excerpts.
 *
 * A constraint violation reaches the caller as the driver's own error rather
 * than an {@link InterlockError}: it means this code wrote a row naming a
 * parent that does not exist, which is a bug here, and `infra` would file it as
 * an environment failure. The message names the constraint that refused it.
