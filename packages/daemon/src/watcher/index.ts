 * Three signals are combined:
 *  1. filesystem events on worktrees, debounced, ignoring `node_modules` and build output;
 *  2. git ref changes (`.git/refs`, packed-refs, `HEAD`);
 *  3. periodic reconciliation, because filesystem events are lossy on macOS.
 *

 * for what the platform dropped, so they are not three ways of doing the same
 * work: a signal marks a worktree and reconciles one repository, while the timer
 * reconciles every repository and re-targets the watches.
 *
 * Steady-state CPU budget is <2%; it is tracked by `pnpm bench`.
