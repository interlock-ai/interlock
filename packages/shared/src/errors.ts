/**
 * Typed errors.
 *
 * Every error carries a stable `code` so callers can react without matching on
 * messages, and an `infra` flag so environmental failures (Docker down,
 * toolchain missing) are never reported to users as conflict Findings.
 *
 * A refused operation is neither: `GIT_COMMAND_REFUSED` means Interlock's own
 * code asked for something the safety rules forbid, so it is a bug here rather
 * than a broken environment or a property of the repository under analysis.
 *
 * `API_REQUEST_INVALID` is the daemon saying it cannot serve the request as
 * asked — an unknown route, a method it does not answer, a path it cannot
 * decode. It is separate from `UNAUTHORIZED` because a client reacts to the two
 * differently, and telling someone to check their token when they sent the
 * wrong method is worse than saying nothing.
 */

/**
 * An array rather than a bare union, because a code arrives over the API as
 * well as from this process: a client reading one out of a response body has to
 * be able to ask whether it is a code at all before treating it as one.
