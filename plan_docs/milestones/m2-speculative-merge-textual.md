# M2 — Speculative merge and textual detection

**Goal:** Early warning for textual conflicts. This is the first real demo.

**Exit criteria:** two live agent sessions edit the same function; Interlock
raises a textual-conflict Finding in under 60 seconds while both sessions are
still running.

**Depends on:** M1.

Two different costs get solved in two different places, and confusing them is
the fastest way to build the wrong thing:

- **Merge cost** is solved by `git merge-tree --write-tree`. It merges in the
  object database with no checkout, no working directory and no index lock.
- **Typecheck cost** is solved by the scheduler, and only by the scheduler.
  A semantic conflict is by definition a merge that came out _clean_, so
  `merge-tree` never filters those out — every clean pair is a typecheck
  candidate. Deciding which of them is worth the compiler is the whole problem.

Typecheck cost is the budget that decides whether this product runs on a laptop.

## Tasks

- [ ] **Watcher survives Node ≥ 26.9's recursive watcher on Linux**
      **Files:** `packages/daemon/src/watcher/worktree-watcher.ts`, `packages/daemon/src/main.ts`
      **What:** a watched worktree that becomes unreadable must not take the daemon down.

  Node 26.9.0 rewrote `lib/internal/fs/recursive_watch.js`, and its
  `#onFolderEvent` calls `lstatSync` on a path inside the directory an event
  named with only `ENOENT` suppressed — so a directory that just became
  unreadable throws `EACCES` from inside Node's own callback, past every
  `'error'` listener, and the process dies. Reproduced against 26.4.0 (emits
  `'error'`, survives) and 26.9.0 (uncaught, dies); the reproducer and the
  line are in `log.md` under 2026-09-21. CI is pinned to `.node-version` so the
  required check does not see it; users on a newer Node do.

  Two shapes, and the second is the real one. A process-level
  `uncaughtException` handler in `main.ts` matching this exact signature —
  `EACCES` from `recursive_watch` — logs and continues, and is a workaround for
  a named upstream bug that goes when the bug does. Owning the recursion in
  the watcher — one `fs.watch` per directory, added as directories appear and
  dropped as they go, with the ignore rules applied to what is walked — is
  what makes the daemon independent of Node's recursive implementation on
  Linux, which has had more than one of these. On Linux Node's own recursive
  watcher does exactly that walk anyway, so the cost is the same and the
  errors are ours to handle. File the regression upstream either way.

  **Done when:** the twelve-line reproducer from `log.md`, run against the
  daemon's watcher rather than `fs.watch`, survives on Node 26.9.0 on Linux;
  the unreadable-worktree test in `packages/cli/test/status.test.ts` passes
  ten times running on that Node; and the workaround, if that is the shape
  taken, names the Node version it exists for and is asserted to be reached.
  **Constraints:** hard rule 5 — the test that trips this is correct and stays.

- [ ] **Shadow clone lifecycle**
      **Files:** `packages/core/src/git/shadow.ts`
      **What:** `ensureShadow` — one clone per user repo under the data dir, sharing the origin's object store.
      **Done when:** a second call returns the existing shadow rather than re-cloning, and the shadow's objects are shared, not copied.
      **Constraints:** `ensureShadow` is the only way to obtain a `ShadowRepo`, and a `ShadowRepo` is the only thing mutating functions accept. Keep it that way — the type split is what makes a write to a user repo a compile error.

- [ ] **Snapshot commits**
      **Files:** `packages/core/src/git/worktree.ts`
      **What:** `commitSnapshotInShadow` — turn an M1 dirty-state tree into a real commit inside the shadow, so uncommitted work can be merged.
      **Done when:** a conflict between two sets of uncommitted changes is detectable before either side has committed anything. This is the capability that makes Interlock different from a merge queue.

- [ ] **Pairwise merge with `merge-tree`**
      **Files:** `packages/core/src/merge/speculative-merge.ts`
      **What:** merge two commits with `git merge-tree --write-tree` inside the shadow. Returns the merged tree id when clean, and the conflicted paths with their stages when not. No worktree, no checkout.
      **Done when:** a clean pair returns a tree id and a conflicting pair returns its conflicted paths; neither creates a working directory; and the timing per pair is recorded in `log.md`.
      **Constraints:** a conflict is a result, not an error — throw only when the merge could not be attempted at all. `merge-tree` needs git 2.38+; detect and report `TOOLCHAIN_UNSUPPORTED` on older git rather than silently falling back.

- [ ] **Textual conflict classification**
      **Files:** `packages/core/src/merge/conflict-classifier.ts`, `packages/core/src/analyzers/textual.ts`
      **What:** turn `merge-tree`'s conflict output into Findings carrying file and hunk spans on both branches.
      **Done when:** each Finding names both branches, both spans and the merge-base, and a fixture suite covers add/add, edit/edit, edit/delete and rename/edit.
      **Constraints:** evidence is machine-checkable — spans and tool output, never prose alone.

- [ ] **Per-pair worktree pool**
      **Files:** `packages/core/src/git/shadow.ts`
      **What:** an LRU pool of persistent per-pair worktrees under the data dir, default size 4, configurable. A pair enters only after the overlap filter marks it worth watching. Update a slot by delta: `merge-tree --write-tree` → `commit-tree` → `reset --hard` inside that pair's worktree, so only changed files are rewritten. See ADR-0005.
      **Done when:** a second check of the same pair rewrites only the files that differ and is measurably faster than the first; `.tsbuildinfo` survives between checks of a slot; eviction is logged with its cost; and an aborted run leaves the slot usable rather than half-written.
      **Constraints:** pool worktrees keep a **detached HEAD** so no branch ref moves. `reset --hard` is a mutating command and is permitted here only because pool worktrees belong to the shadow clone — the runtime `isMutatingCommand` check and `user-repo-untouched.test.ts` both still apply unchanged. If either branch or the merge touches `package.json` or the lockfile, mark the pair `deps-dirty` and route to a slow install path, or skip the semantic check and say why; the symlinked `node_modules` is wrong for that pair and typechecking against it produces confident nonsense.

- [ ] **Scheduler v1**
      **Files:** `packages/daemon/src/scheduler/`
      **What:** decide which pairs get merged, and which clean merges are worth a semantic check. Debounce, mark pairs stale when a branch moves, abort superseded runs, cap concurrency. Rank candidates by file overlap first, then symbol overlap.
      **Done when:** with 5 branches under continuous edit, work stays inside the CPU budget, no pair is analysed twice for the same snapshot pair, and both the escalation rate and the pool eviction rate are reported.
      **Constraints:** this is where the project succeeds or fails. `notes.md` beside this code explains the algorithm — update it in the same change. Never analyse all N² pairs eagerly, and never escalate a clean merge to the compiler without an overlap reason. **Prefer re-checking a hot pooled pair over rotating a new one in.** Stickiness is a cost control of the same rank as overlap filtering, because every eviction discards incremental compiler state and the next check of that pair pays the cold cost again — round-robin fairness across pairs is the worst available strategy.

- [ ] **Analyzer result caching**
      **Files:** `packages/daemon/src/store/`
      **What:** cache verdicts on `(snapshotA, snapshotB, analyzer, toolchain)`.
      **Done when:** re-running an unchanged pair does no work at all.

- [ ] **False-positive budget**
      **Files:** `packages/daemon/src/store/`, `packages/core/src/advisor/`
      **What:** count findings raised, findings delivered, and findings later dismissed or resolved as wrong. Expose the ratio.
      **Done when:** the daemon can report its own false-positive rate for a time window, and `interlock status` shows it.
      **Constraints:** the design rule is **when unsure, say nothing**. A tool that catches 60% of conflicts and never lies is a product; one that catches 95% and cries wolf twice a day is uninstalled within a week. Every false positive is a bug with an issue, not a tuning parameter.

- [ ] **`interlock check A B`**
      **Files:** `packages/cli/src/commands/`
      **What:** force an immediate merge of a named pair and print the findings.
      **Done when:** it reports a planted conflict in a fixture repo with usable output.

- [ ] **Fixture suite**
      **Files:** `eval/fixtures/`
      **What:** small synthetic repos with planted, labelled conflicts, built programmatically in temp dirs.
      **Done when:** each fixture states which pair conflicts, which analyzer should catch it, and which file and symbol. Include negative twins — pairs that look similar and are genuinely independent.
      **Constraints:** the fixture lands before the rule it exercises. Once written, `eval/` is read-only to coding sessions.

- [ ] **Turn the coverage gate on**
      **Files:** `vitest.config.ts`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
      **What:** restore the `packages/core/src/**` threshold at 80% lines and functions, and restore the `coverage` CI job that runs it.
      **Done when:** CI fails when `core` drops below the threshold. Both were removed while `core` was mostly declarations — the gate measured nothing and the job discarded its own output. By now there is an implementation to measure.
